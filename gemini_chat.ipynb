      "Welcome to the Gemini Chatbot! Type 'exit' to end the chat.\n",
      "You:  Can you do OCR?\n",
      "Chatbot:  Yes, I can perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images or scanned documents. I can recognize text in various languages and can output the extracted text in different formats such as plain text, JSON, or structured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simplified demonstration of how I perform OCR:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Image Preprocessing:** I receive an image file as input. To prepare the image for text recognition, I may perform various preprocessing steps such as noise removal, thresholding, and skew correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Text Detection:** I use computer vision algorithms to locate and identify text regions within the image. This involves detecting individual characters or words and grouping them into meaningful text lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Character Recognition:** Once the text regions are identified, I apply advanced deep learning models to recognize individual characters. I leverage large datasets of labeled text images to train these models, enabling them to recognize a wide range of fonts, styles, and languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Text Extraction:** The recognized characters are then assembled into words, sentences, and paragraphs, forming the complete extracted text. I can output the extracted text in various formats, including plain text, JSON, or structured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Accuracy and Confidence:** I provide confidence scores for each recognized character and word, indicating the likelihood of their accuracy. This information can be useful for evaluating the reliability of the extracted text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Import the necessary library\n",
      "import pytesseract\n",
      "\n",
      "# Define the path to the input image\n",
      "image_path = \"path/to/input_image.jpg\"\n",
      "\n",
      "# Perform OCR using Pytesseract\n",
      "extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_path)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Print the extracted text\n",
      "print(extracted_text)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The accuracy and efficiency of OCR depend on factors such as the quality of the input image, the complexity of the text, and the language used.\n",
      "You:  thanks\n",
      "Chatbot:  You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n",
      "Chatbot: Goodbye!\n"
